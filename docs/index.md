[CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) is an open-source application. The code can be
poked, prodded, twisted, and hacked. It can be customized, extended, and
collaboratively developed. This documentation tells you how to do that.

It starts with a high level introduction to get you familiar
with CiviCRM development. It covers setting up your developement environment,
checking whether or not you actually need to implement your own custom code (i.e. you can't achieve what you
want through configuration or installing an already existing extension), best
practice ways to extend CiviCRM (a.k.a. how to write an extension), things you
should know before you start hacking on core, and best practice for testing.

The guide also includes detailed references for tools and subsystems
of CiviCRM. These cover topics like the API and hook system and are intended
for use by people that are familiar with CiviCRM development.
